This is a thing by The Royals. We built it because, yeah. Why not.

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night.

What, well you mean like a date? Scram, McFly. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?
