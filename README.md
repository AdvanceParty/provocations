### Local Dev server

You can use the Now CLI to start a local dev server and watch for changes to src files. The local server also includes support for testing the serverless functions in your /api directory without the need for deployment to Now.

```shell
now dev
```

### Deploying From Your Terminal

```shell
$ now
```
